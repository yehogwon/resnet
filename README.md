# An Implementation of ResNet with PyTorch

This is a PyTorch implementation of ResNet with [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) and [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. This implementation is based on the original paper of ResNet: [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385).
